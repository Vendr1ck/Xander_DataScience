The most serious flooding occurred in Newport Beach and Irvine during the early afternoon.  Several Newport  schools had flooded classrooms and were evacuated.  In Irvine, water and mud rushing through Bommer Canyon flooded 25 townhomes and a city park.  Lightning also struck a home in Irvine, blowing out windows, damaging the roof, and causing a gas line rupture.  In Dana Point, a tree-covered hillside slid into a hotel parking structure, submerging at least six cars in rock and sand.  Local State of Emergencies were declared in San Clemente, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, and Irvine.  Elsewhere throughout the valley areas of southwest California, several mud slides closed roads and blocked drainage channels, exacerbating the already high water levels.  Numerous swift-water and standing-water rescues were made as water quickly surrounded homes and cars. Gusty winds easily pushed over trees whose shallow root systems were anchored in water-logged soil, damaging homes and automobiles, and causing sporadic power outages.  Sink holes began to open up, undermining some roadways.  Over two inches of rain along the San Diego River late on the seventh and early on the eighth, sent the river out of it's banks.  It crested at 12.5 feet at Fashion Valley during the morning of the eighth, which is 1.2 feet above flood stage.

The second storm was located off the central California coast, and was impressive on satellite pictures with a tightly-wound structure and a clear center much like the eye of a tropical system. The circulation around the storm produced a southerly wind over the Tehachapi Mountains which funneled through Tejon Pass and down the Grapevine into the south end of the San Joaquin Valley.

Numerous trees were toppled in both the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra foothills by winds, in many cases pulling down power lines. One thunderstorm at Squaw Valley in the foothills produced a gust estimated at 65 mph, which toppled trees and damaged the roof of a garage. On the Valley floor, there were reports of houses and parked vehicles damaged by falling trees or large limbs.
